# tamagotchi-town
This repo is the result of about a week or two reverse engineering a Super Famicom/Super Nintendo game, Tamagotchi Town. I RE'd everything I care to with it and am not particularly interested in working on this anymore (no attachment to or knowledge of the property). Part of me doubts someone would want to continue work on this (possible English translation patch someday?), but I don't want the info to remain trapped in a Discord server or my computer. So I'm making these resources available for whoever does want to work on this.

# Included items
- A partial disassembly of the game, as a [DiztinGUIsh](https://github.com/IsoFrieze/DiztinGUIsh) project file.
- Two tools coded in Java, for handling the game's graphics compression format. You will need this in order to change the game's font, plus a handful of other graphics in the game that contain Japanese text.
  - A compressor to put your graphics edits into the format the game expects.
  - A decompressor to dump the graphics from the game. Can also use to confirm that output from the compressor correctly "round-trips" from raw data -> compressed data -> identical raw data when decompressed.
- An [Asar](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar) assembly hack to change the game's text printing routine to use half-width characters (8x16) instead of full-width characters (16x16). It should let you fit about twice as many characters per row of text than originally possible.
  - See the `images` folder for sample screenshots comparing the original full-width Japanese text and the modded "half-width" (left half only) Japanese text.
- A set-up for [Cartographer](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/647/) to dump out the game's two scripts. One is for descriptions of Tamagotchis. The other is for everything else.
  - I recommend that you regex all the `W16` commands in the output to `W24` commands. That it uses `W16` is an artifact of ignoring the bank bytes of the 24-bit pointers in the text pointer tables (game is LoROM + FastROM, so banks 80-9F instead of 00-1F). Cartographer wouldn't correctly dump text for me otherwise.
  - An untested sample [Atlas](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/224/) header for the scripts.
- Table files for the two scripts.
- Assorted notes about the game's inner workings. More detailed notes can be found in the DiztinGUIsh project file.

# Base ROM specification
First, do not ask me where to obtain a dump of the game. It should be a 1 MB file that conforms to the specification in the [No-Intro database](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=49&n=2979):
```
CRC32:	2c877794
MD5:	c9bfaa0cf1365a1ae1d9be62abe0366b

# Why I did this
You're probably asking something to the effect of, "If you don't care about Tamagotchis, why did you bother working on this?" Short answer, I was bored.

A user `aaamdacagua` in what used to be the romhacking.net Discord (now the Discord for romhack.ing) had made a post/thread there in late October 2023 about wanting to work on this game. They and another user who joined in, `Bunkai`, were having some trouble figuring out the game's text encoding. They had already IDed most of the characters in the font but were stumped about what hex values went to what characters.

TL;DR: The encoding order is conceptually similar to values going `00 01 02 03...`, but not this order verbatim. Importantly, the order made it so a basic relative search wouldn't help much.

I had been working on translating [Otogirisou](https://github.com/ButThouMust/otogirisou-en-beta), saw the post, and thought, "It's a Tamagotchi game. How difficult can it be?" I was itching for a programming/RE challenge anyway after doing translation work.

It took a few hours, but I ended up finding the game's text printing routine, the encoding order, and the script's uncompressed text. I shared my notes there. In retrospect, I do feel like I had robbed the learning opportunity from aaamdacagua, but I suppose that someone would have figured it out eventually.

About a week later, I tried looking into how the game's two fonts were stored in the game. It turned out that they were compressed, and I was able to get a graphics decompressor working for it. It also ended up being the same compression format for a lot of other graphics in the game. I shared the decompressor source code on the Discord, and that was where activity in the Discord post/thread ended.

Fast forward to early October 2024. I remembered I had all this (minus the graphics recompressor; I adapted the one I made for another ROM hacking project) and decided to create this repository just to put it out there and not hoard the info to myself.
